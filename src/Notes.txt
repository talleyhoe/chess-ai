ToDo:
    - Finish constructors for all pieces. Default constructor should start us
      in the initial position.
    - Add calculation of check and pin masks to a struct that will hold all 
      possible moves. 
      - Once you fill a sliding piece, it should contain all attacked pieces.
        If you prune those pieces from the propegator and refill, you'll be 
        left with the pin attacks. En passant can remove two pieces on the 
        same rank, your own and your enemy's. So treat en passant as an
        alternative board position and rescan if needed. Should be able to run
        in compile time 
    - Include logic for pawn promotion
